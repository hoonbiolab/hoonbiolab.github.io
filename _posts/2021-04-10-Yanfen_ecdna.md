<hr>

**Congratulations, Yanfen & Amit !!!**

Zhu et al. report the chromatin connectivity networks of circular and extrachromosomal DNA elements (ecDNA) in cancer, revealing that ecDNAs can function as mobile super-enhancers, which drives genome-wide transcriptional amplification, including that of oncogenes. These findings support an expanded role for ecDNA in trans-regulating chromosomal genes in promoting tumor growth.
