The mission of the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) Consortium is to create a longitudinal molecular reference data set that can be used to characterize and understand the processes that drive glioma evolution and therapy resistance. Towards that goal, the first GLASS Data Resource was released today, consisting of multiple time-point exome and/or whole genome sequencing profiles from 257 glioma patients.

Patient data and matching clinical annotations were provided by many labs across the world; data pre-processing was all done by the Verhaak laboratory. For more information, see [www.glass-consortium.org](https://www.glass-consortium.org/).
