<hr>

We have a current opening for MS/PhD positions!

### Hiring Areas
- Computational Biology / Bioinformatics / Machine Learning or related
- Cell biology / Immunology or related (*we will teach computing*)

### Research area

* [Tumor evolution]({{site.url}}/glass)
* [Extrachromosomal oncogenes]({{site.url}}/tags/#ecDNA)
* Genomics
* Mutational processes
* Tumor microenvironment
* Biomedical data analysis system
* Machine learning applications in understanding diseases
* Neurodegenerative disease (expected)

### Description

**"Our lab is all about big data."**

Innovation in health care has been fueled by the access to large amounts of biomolecular data, fast computing capacity, and advances in profiling technologies and molecular tools. A major goal of our lab research is, by integrating the quantitative sciences with biomedical research, to enhance our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases, and eventually promote improved human health. We look for graduate students (pursuing a PhD program) that are interested in understanding diseases and its genetic underpinnings in order to make these findings clinically relevant. Graduate students have the opportunity to leverage big biomolecular data (i.e., genomics, imaging) obtained from patients with an extremely sophisticated computational infrastructure and biomolecular techniques.

### Hiring process

- Looking for graduate students (MS, or PhD (preferred))
- Research intern positions are available until they join the academic program (starting 2021 Fall semester).
- If you are interested in the above positions, email “Hoon Kim” (wisekh6@gmail.com) with your CV. Additional documents (statement of purpose, academic certificate) required for joing the academic program will be requested later.
