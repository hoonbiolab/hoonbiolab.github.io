<hr>

We have a current opening for a post-doctoral position!

### Research area

* [Tumor evolution]({{site.url}}/glass)
* [Extrachromosomal oncogenes]({{site.url}}/tags/#ecDNA)
* Single-cell (DNA/RNA/ATAC) sequencing

### Description

**"Our lab is all about big data."**

Innovation in health care has been fueled by the access to large amounts of biomolecular data, fast computing capacity, and advances in profiling technologies and molecular tools. A major goal of our lab research is, by integrating the quantitative sciences with biomedical research, to enhance our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases, and eventually promote improved human health. We look for a postdoctoral scientist that is interested in understanding diseases and its genetic underpinnings in order to make these findings clinically relevant. She/He has the opportunity to leverage big biomolecular data (i.e., genomics, imaging) obtained from patients with an extremely sophisticated computational infrastructure and biomolecular techniques.

### Qualifications

- MD or PhD in genetics, computational biology, molecular/cell biology, or other quantitative science.
- Prior research experience in one of the following areas will be preferred: cancer, quantitative biology, CRISPR/Cas9 (epi)genome editing.
- Track record of productivity supported by first-author publications in peer-reviewed journals.
- Outstanding writing and communication skills, with an ability to work both independently and within collaborative teams productively.
